What is contained in this project.

1. A list of tasks which covers many basic points in spider development, each task is a short exercise. You will be able to solve real complex  problem after you solve the simple tasks step by step. This idea derive from `code kata <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming)>`_ 

2. Some advanced tips and notes which help you improve the development productivity, and it will introduce you to some great tools.

Supplement instead of alternative of scrapy doc
------------------------------------------------

Scrapy doc is a good start for people who want to learn to write spider by using scrapy. Since scrapy doc mainly focuses on the components and concepts in scrapy, some points which make sense in spider development with scrapy are missed in the doc. That is why I created this project.

I did not talk much about components of scrapy in this doc. **It is strongly recommend user to read scrapy** `official doc <https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/index.html>`_  **first to have a basic understanding such as how to create spider and how to run spider in scrapy. You might can not get some points here if you have no idea how the spider work in scrapy**. If you have question for scrapy, please check it in official doc first.

Doc
--------------------

http://scrapy-guru.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

--------------------
Support Platform
--------------------

OSX, Linux, python 2.7+, python 3.4+

------------------------
Get started
------------------------

First, you should take a view of the workflow figure of this project to know how this project works and read `basic concepts <http://scrapy-guru.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#basic-concepts>`_ in doc.

Secondly, user will choose one task in online doc of project and get started, it is recommended to solve the task in doc order considering the learning curve. User should create spider as doc asked and run the spider to get the data as expected. There is a sample spider callled ``basic_extract`` in the project, just follow it to create a new one and troubleshoot. If user can not make the spider work, you can also check the working spider code in the solution repo which I will push later.

Thirdly, user can get some advanced advise or tips in `advanced topic <http://scrapy-guru.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#advanced-topic>`_ , you can learn how to enhance your browser to make it more helpful in spider development and other stuff.

        ├── templates
        └── webapp

* ``docs`` contains the html documentation of this project
* ``webapp`` is a web application developed by ``Django``, we can see this app as a website which show us product info and product links, and we need to write spider to extract the data from it. 
* ``spider_project`` is a project based on ``Scrapy`` which we should write spider in it to extract data from ``webapp``.

--------------------
First glance
--------------------

So here is an example product detail page, it is rendered by ``webapp`` mentioned above.

Now according to `task <http://scrapy-guru.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tasks/basic_extract.html>`_ in the doc, we need to extract product title and desc from the product detail page

Here is part of spider code:

    class Basic_extractSpider(scrapy.Spider):
        taskid = "basic_extract"
        name = taskid
        entry = "content/detail_basic"

        def parse_entry_page(self, response):
            item = SpiderProjectItem()
            item["taskid"] = self.taskid
            data = {}
            title = response.xpath("//div[@class='product-title']/text()").extract()
            desc = response.xpath("//section[@class='container product-info']//li/text()").extract()
            data["title"] = title
            data["desc"] = desc

            item["data"] = data
            yield item

We can run the spider now, the spider will start to crawl from the ``self.entry`` and it will check the data scraped automatically. If the data scraped has some mistakes, it will give the detail of the error and help you to get the spider working as expected.
